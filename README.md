# MP3 Player
Final Project for CSC 290

# How to use
This program is an executable that you can download [here](google.com).
Inside the folder you have there will be a text file where it stores the path.

# Current State & Future plans
Right now it's just a basic MP3 player for the time being, so I have something to submit for a final project. Eventually 
I plan on having this be able to stream music to the client through a raspberry pi.
