# MP3 Player
Final Project for CSC 290

# How to use
This program is an executable that you can download [here](google.com).
Inside the folder you have there will be a text file where it stores the path
to all music you added to the mp3. DO NOT MOVE THIS or else it will not work. If it doesn't
exist it'll create a new one.
