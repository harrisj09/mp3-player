# MP3 Player
Final Project for CSC 290

# How to use
This program is an executable that you can download [here](google.com).
Inside the folder you have there will be a text file where it stores the path
to all music you added to the mp3. DO NOT MOVE THIS or else you will lose all music you have saved. If it doesn't
exist it'll create a new one.

# Current State & Future plans
Right now it's just a basic MP3 player for the time being, so I have something to submit for a final project. Eventually 
I plan on having this be able to stream music to the client through a raspberry pi.
